Mitigating Dictionary Attacks:
To protect against dictionary attacks, organizations can implement the following measures:

Password Policies:
Enforce strong password policies that require a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Require users to choose passwords that are not common or easily guessable.
Password Salting:
Use password salting, where a unique, random value (salt) is added to each password before hashing.
This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their hashed values will be different.
Account Lockout:
Implement account lockout policies that temporarily lock user accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts.
Rate Limiting:
Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent rapid, automated guessing of passwords.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
Require users to authenticate using multiple factors, such as something they know (password) and something they have (smartphone or hardware token).
