How to protect against brute force attacks
Developers who manage authorization systems can take measures such as locking out IP addresses that have generated too many failed logins, and incorporating a delay in their password-checking software.

Users of web services can decrease their vulnerability to brute force attacks by choosing longer, more complex passwords
 It is also recommended to enable two-factor authentication and use unique passwords for each service.

 Users should also avoid entering passwords or personal information such as credit card numbers or banking information with any web service that doesnâ€™t protect their data with strong encryption keys.
