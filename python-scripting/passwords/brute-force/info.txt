bad actors use automated scripts to try out possible passwords until the correct one works. Brute-force attacks can be very time consuming because they take a systematic approach to trying all possible permutations of characters in a sequence.
 The longer the password, the longer it takes. 

 Brute-force attacks are most successful when users have common or weak passwords.
 Admins who want to defend against to these attacks have several options, including: 

Limiting the number of times a password can be tried
Blocking an IP address after it has attempted—and failed—to enter the correct password after a certain number of times
Locking accounts after a certain number of unsuccessful login attempts 
Imposing a time delay between attempts 
Increasing the level of effort, like adding a CAPTCHA or adding multifactor authentication
